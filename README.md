Note: Look for mdn docs for `sort()` functionality. And checkbox.

Let's go step by step:

1. Implement sorting by Price. Use Radio input element for this. **(10m)**

   1. High to Low
   2. Low to High

2. Use checkbox to filter out of stock products **(5m)**

3. Use checkbox to filter out products without fast delivery **(5m)**

4. Use fieldset to cleanup the controls. **(5m)**

5. Clean the overall implementation. Making sure every function is pure and putting things in different files. **(5m)**

6. Homework: Implement the price range control.
